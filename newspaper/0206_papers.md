### Problem Addressed
Derived from abstract in fallback mode.

### Approach
Global warming has intensified the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, which degrade CCTV signal and video quality while disrupting traffic flow, thereby increasing traffic accident rates. Existing datasets, often limited to light haze, rain, and snow, fail to capture extreme weather conditions. To address this gap, this study introduces the Traffic Surveillance B...

### Methodological Novelty
Fallback mode: infer novelty from abstract wording.

### Empirical Novelty
Fallback mode: infer empirical evidence from abstract wording.

### Problem Addressed
Derived from abstract in fallback mode.

### Approach
Trajectory prediction and planning are fundamental yet disconnected components in autonomous driving. Prediction models forecast surrounding agent motion under unknown intentions, producing multimodal distributions, while planning assumes known ego objectives and generates deterministic trajectories. This mismatch creates a critical bottleneck: prediction lacks supervision for ...

### Problem Addressed
Derived from abstract in fallback mode.

### Approach
Accurate traffic flow prediction remains a fundamental challenge in intelligent transportation systems, particularly in cross-domain, data-scarce scenarios where limited historical data hinders model training and generalisation. The complex spatio-temporal dependencies and nonlinear dynamics of urban mobility networks further complicate few-shot learning across different cities...
